U-Net is one of the most popular architecture used for sematic segmentation. The goal of semantic image segmentation is to label each pixel of an image with a corresponding class of what is being represented.U-Net is built using a contracting path, which captures high-resolution, contextual features while downsampling at each layer, and an expanding path, which increases the resolution of the output
through upsampling at each layer. The features from the contracting path are fused with features from the expanding path through long skip connections, ensuring localization of the extracted contextual features.
